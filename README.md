## Description
* Develop a full authentication application using React to manage user registration, login, and logout functionalities securely. 
* Allow users to create a new account by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password. 
* Display appropriate error messages for invalid login attempts. 
* Use secure password hashing on the server side. 
* Implement session management and token-based authentication for secure user sessions. 
* Create a protected dashboard accessible only after successful login. 
* Also provide a secure logout mechanism. 

## Built With
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) This is a cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine used in running JavaScript codes on the server. It allows for installation and managing of dependencies and communication with databases.
* [ExpressJS](https://www.expresjs.org/) This is a NodeJS web application framework.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) This is a free open source NOSQL document database with scalability and flexibility. Data are stored in flexible JSON-like documents.
* [Mongoose ODM](https://mongoosejs.com/) This makes it easy to write MongoDB validation by providing a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model to application data.
